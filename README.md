SebastAIn is a personal chat bot based off of a locally running Mistral model. By using a custom prompt input file, users can define the AI's personality and purpose. 
The project uses Ollama for pulling and running a model, along with Ollama4j to interface with the running model.

Requirements:
Ollama
Locally running LLM model (code can be configured for any model available in Ollama)

Current functionality:
1. Console output chat
2. Selectable prompt input via files located in "resources"

Future implemetation plans:
1. Voice to text input
2. Text to voice output
3. Visual screen model representation, likely via VTubeStudio or Veadotube
4. Twitch stream output
